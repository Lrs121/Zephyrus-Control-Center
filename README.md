## Zephyrus Control Center
Armoury Crate if it wasn't Trash. Gorgeous UI without nonsense promotional garbage. Designed on and for the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 2022.

## Features
**Gorgeus UI**  
Who said functional stuff can't look good? Thanks to AvaloniaUI, Zephyrus Control Center provides a rich user interface while providing the user with everything they need to take control of the proprietary ASUS bullshit. Also matches the entire Windows 11 UI. Pretty cool, huh?

**Fan control**  
Built-in fan curve configuration, fan speed overrides, manufacturer performance preset selection.

**Temperature readout**  
Reads on-board temperatures using the embedded controller. No external modules required.

**Graphics & display control**  
Configures overdrive, switch between discrete and integrated GPU.

**Battery charging threshold & PPT control**  
Configures maximum battery charge limit and maximum power draw.

**AURA & keybinds control**  
Built-in keyboard backlight configuration, animations, synchronization with system color scheme, custom keybinds, media key mapping.

**AniMe Matrix control**  
/not-yet-implemented/ Custom pluggable module support, picture/GIF display, hardware animation configuration.  

## Where do I get it from?
Once I deem it finished, probably from Releases page. For now feel free to clone the repository and build it yourself. :)

## But I doesn't support <feature> and/or uses too much resources!!
Go ahead and use [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper) then.
I made ZCC for myself, if you find it useful, cool. If it doesn't work for you - *I don't care*. 
Feel free to use the sources and build something that works better for you with them. __Just remember to respect the license__.
